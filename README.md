# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python. Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze data, handle missing values, create visualizations, and extract insights on survival patterns.
# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to extract insights and understand patterns that influenced passenger survival.

# Dataset
The dataset is : Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
Link of Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv&utm_source=chatgpt.com

# Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

# What I did
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Handled missing values in 'Age' and 'Embarked' columns
- Visualized distributions and relationships using plots (countplots, histograms, boxplots, heatmaps)
- Analyzed survival rates across different groups (gender, class, age)
- Summarized key findings about factors affecting survival

# Files Included
- `train.csv` — Dataset file
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with code and visualizations
- `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf` — PDF report summarizing findings (if created)
